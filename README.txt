Requirements: Have SFML & C++ installed

Uses SQL-like syntax and shares similar features!

Create a table:
CREATE TABLE tableName (col1, col2, col3)
/// Creates a table with specified column names.

Insert into a table:
INSERT INTO tableName (col1, col2, col3) VALUES (val1, val2, val3)
/// Adds a new row to the table.

Select columns:
SELECT col1, col2 FROM tableName WHERE (col1)
/// Highlights specified columns in the table.
if you want to select just one column, you can do something like this:
SELECT col1 FROM tableName WHERE (col1)

Delete a table:
DELETE TABLE tableName
/// Removes the table completely.



Hope you enjoy!!!!!
